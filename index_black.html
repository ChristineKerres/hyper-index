                Ry Cuming, better known by the stage name RY X, is an Australian singer-songwriter and musician. He first found success in 2013, with his single “Berlin”, which charted in the U.K. Top 40.

He was born in Angourie in New South Wales and grew up with music from artists like Jeff Buckley and Pearl Jam, which influenced his early music. In 2010, he moved to Los Angeles, California, where he kept working on music and was noticed by the label Jive Records on which he released his self-titled debut album under his real name in the same year. After going on tour with Maroon 5 as their opening act, his next release after a small break was published in 2012 with the single “Howling”, now calling himself RY X. After signing to the label Dumont Dumont, he released the EP “Berlin”, of which the title track was used in an European Sony advertising campaign, which lead to a huge success. When he released his RY X debut album “Dawn” in 2016, it charted in several countries and was received very well.
After another break, he released the single “Untold” in October 2018, announcing his second album called “Unfurl” to be released in February 2019.

                Keaton Henson (born 24 March 1988) is an English folk rock musician, visual artist and poet from London, England.

Henson initially started recording songs in his apartment in London purely for his own consumption, but after he gave a recording of one of his songs as a gift to his best friend, he was encouraged to put his music online.

He self-released his debut album Dear… in November, 2010. Henson has released six studio albums, with one released under the name Behaving, as well as a book of poetry called Idiot Verse.

Henson got his breakthrough when Zane Lowe played the song “You Don’t Know How Lucky You Are” on BBC Radio 1 for the first time on September 7, 2011.

As a musician Henson usually sings and plays guitar or the piano. He suffers from serious stage fright so he rarely plays bigger concerts and prefers to play at smaller venues, galleries or museums.

            Jorja Alice Smith (born June 11, 1997), better known as Jorja Smith, is an English R&B singer-songwriter from Walsall, West Midlands.

Born to a Jamaican father and an English mother, Smith grew up listening to reggae, punk, hip-hop and R&B. She began writing songs at the age of 11, and cites Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, Adele, Sade, Nina Simone, and the Streets as her biggest influences, as well as Amy Winehouse, about whom she claims to have been “obsessed” with her 2003 debut album Frank, as a teenager. Amy’s raw approach to songwriting has been a major inspiration for Smith, who now likes to address social issues in her songs:

When things are going on in the world, I think it’s important to touch on them, because as a musician, you can make people listen. As soon as people press play, you’ve got their attention.

            Men I Trust is an indie-electro-dream pop trio from Quebec City, Quebec formed in 2014 and made up of Jessy Caron (guitar, bass, keyboards), Emma Proulx (vocals) and Dragos Chiriac (keyboards, mastering). Former singer (2014-2015) was Odile Marmet-Rochefort.

They are all in DIY: record, mix, master, shoot their music videos themselves and self-manage.

In an interview, the band explained their songwriting: “We will never write about something we don’t feel deeply and directly about. So that’s why a lot of our lyrics are kind of philosophic ideas, because they convey a general feeling that we have. It’s important for us that the lyrics be timeless, so we can think about the lyrics longer than the music. It’s always something that happened to us. It’s never an imaginary story or character. It’s always true and true to us. The three of us have to feel it.”

In a Reddit live Q&A, Emma stated about their band name: “Jessy and Dragos created the band before I arrived and they wanted to have a positive band name. They first wanted to call it simply ‘Trust’ but the name was already taken. It became Men I Trust.”

            The 1975 consists of Matthew Healy (vocals/guitar), Adam Hann (lead guitar), George Daniel (drums), and Ross MacDonald (bass), all of whom are from Macclesfield in Cheshire, England. The four band members, now based in Manchester, met in Secondary School and began playing together as teenagers.

The eclectic four-piece band have amorphous drifts between brooding art rock, crisp electronica, dancefloor R&B, and 80’s gloss pop, as well as lead singer Matthew “Matty” Healy’s stories of lust, intoxication, and the unabashed grittiness of modern youth. Common themes in their lyrics range anywhere from dysfunctional relationships, to the failure of modernity.

            Originally formed 2004 in Baltimore, Maryland, Beach House is an American dream-pop duo consisting of of French-born Victoria Legrand (vocals, keyboards) and Baltimore native Alex Scally (guitar, keyboards).

Despite their summery name, Beach House creates music that is dark, dreamy, and alluringly hypnotic. In an interview with LiveAbout, Scally summarized their music as following:

I think that’s very much what the ‘beach house’ feel is: going off to a different world. It’s not really a vacation; vacation for me is when you go away, but you’re still thinking about all the things you’ve left behind.

Their self-titled debut released in early October 2006 via Carpark Records, the same label who also distributed 2008’s Devotion. Since 2010’s Teen Dream are Beach House signed to Sub Pop Records.

The duo’s critically acclaimed fourth studio album, Bloom, peaked at #7 on the Billboard 200 chart in June 2012, following its May release.

            Benjamin Clementine is an English musician, multi-instrumentalist, poet, artist and singer-songwriter born and raised in London. He later moved to Paris, France where he became homeless in his teenage years and started to busk on the streets of Paris. His performances made him a cult figure in the music and art scene. His music is part of the art pop, contemporary classical and experimental pop genres. His debut album ‘At Least for Now’ was released in 2015 and earned Clementine the Mercury Prize. It contained some of his most popular songs such as ‘Condolence’, ‘Nemesis’, ‘London’, ‘Adios’ and ‘Cornerstone’. His sophomore album ‘I Tell a Fly’ experimented with more instrumentation than his debut, introducing the harpsichord and various avant-garde elements. This album contained some more fan-favourite songs like ‘Phantom of Aleppoville’, ‘Jupiter’, ‘Quintessence’, ‘Ave Dreamer’ and ‘One Awkward Fish’.

            London Grammar is an indie-pop trio made up of Hannah Reid, Dan Rothman, and Dot Major. Described as a group made in a “post ‘The xx’” era, London Grammar defies and transcends any comparisons.

The group formed in 2009 at Nottingham University where they were attending, with Rothman studying Economics, Reid wanting to be a psychoanalyst, and Major working on his English (Dot) major. Reid and Rothman corresponded via Facebook and met up to collaborate and shortly thereafter spotted Major playing djembe in the Student Union and asked him to join. They played a few local shows and had positive feedback, but their real breakthrough was when they recorded and posted to YouTube their song “Hey Now” in 2012, which was received to much acclaim. Ministry of Sound took notice and signed them.

            Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (b. December 18, 2001), known professionally as Billie Eilish, is an American singer and songwriter born and raised in Los Angeles, California.

Working alongside her older brother Finneas, her co-writer and producer, she’s taken the internet by storm with her haunting vocals and eerily beautiful lyrics and genre-defying production that was poised to breakout.

For Billie, creating music wasn’t always her niche—dancing was. Born and raised in the entertainment mecca of Los Angeles, from a family comprised of musicians and actors, Billie was enthralled in the spotlight of dance. However, amid a growth plate injury in 2015, she was in practice for a recital dancing eleven hours a week for, she became an underground pop sensation.
